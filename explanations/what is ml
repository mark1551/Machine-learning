Machine learning has various types of definitions explained by many people  for example 
As per :
Arthur Samuel (1959)
 Machine learning: "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed"
  Samuels wrote a checkers playing program
  Had the program play 10000 games against itself
  Work out which board positions were good and bad depending on wins/losses
Tom Michel (1999)
 Well posed learning problem: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."
  The checkers example, 
  E = 10000s games
  T is playing checkers
  P if you win or not
so we can say machine learning has quite a few defintions but the motive of this domain remains the same and that is technique for data analysis that computerizes logical model structure. 
It is a part of man-made brainpower dependent on the possibility that frameworks can gain from information, distinguish examples and settle on choices with negligible human intercession.

Several types of learning algorithms
Supervised learning:
Show the PC how to accomplish something, at that point let it use it's newly discovered information to do it 
Unsupervised learning
Let the computer learn how to do something, and use this to determine structure and patterns in data
Reinforcement learning
Recommender systems
